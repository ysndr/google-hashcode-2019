# Google Hashcode Submission

Quickly hacked last ~minute~ day submission for Google Hashcode.
Only task `b` was scored and yielded ~200k points for what it's worth


------

After implementing our own judge script following were the unofficial results:

| Task | Points |
|:-----|:-------|
| a    | 2      |
| b    | 203859 |
| c    | 1366   |
| d    | 295304 |
| e    | 395933 |
|      |        |
| total| 896464 |

This would have accounted for a 743th place in the extended round globally and 56th place in germany. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
